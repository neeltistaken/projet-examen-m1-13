# Biblio'tech - Groupe 13

Biblio'tech is a dynamic website that offers an interactive collection of books and authors. Users can manually add authors through a user-friendly interface and view the number of books per author. Clicking on an author displays the details of the associated books, with the option to delete that author. Although a user management system has not been implemented due to time constraints, Biblio'tech provides a rich and intuitive user experience for browsing and managing literary data.
